       Strategies for trading based on mathematical and statistical models have historically provided better returns than their counterparts, mutual funds, and benchmarks.
We have developed mathematical and statistical models that offer higher returns. We have also completely automated the process, meaning that the system can set stops, entries, and targets automatically based upon the strategies.
In practice, the term "stock market" often refers to one of the major stock market indexes, such as the Dow Jones Industrial Average or the S&P 500. These represent large sections of the stock market. Because it's hard to track every single company, the performance of the indexes is viewed as representative of the entire market.

You might see a news headline that says the stock market has moved lower, or that the stock market closed up or down for the day. Most often, this means stock market indexes have moved up or down, meaning the stocks within the index have either gained or lost value as a whole. Investors who buy and sell stocks hope to turn a profit through this movement in stock prices.
The stock market works through a network of exchanges — you may have heard of the New York Stock Exchange or the Nasdaq. Companies list shares of their stock on an exchange through a process called an initial public offering, or IPO. Investors purchase those shares, which allows the company to raise money to grow its business. Investors can then buy and sell these stocks among themselves.

Buyers offer a “bid,” or the highest amount they’re willing to pay, which is usually lower than the amount sellers “ask” for in exchange. This difference is called the bid-ask spread. For a trade to occur, a buyer needs to increase his price or a seller needs to decrease hers.

This all may sound complicated, but computer algorithms generally do most price-setting calculations. When buying stock, you’ll see the bid, ask, and bid-ask spread on your broker's website, but in many cases, the difference will be pennies, and won’t be of much concern for beginner and long-term investors.
